# Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Kenyan Politics – Project Plan

## **1. Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze public sentiment around Kenyan politics by extracting, cleaning, and analyzing tweets related to key political figures, parties, and trending political topics. This will provide insights into public opinion, voter sentiment, and political trends in Kenya.

---

## **2. Project Objectives**

* **Understand Public Sentiment:** Assess how Kenyans feel about key political figures, parties, and major political events.
* **Track Political Trends:** Identify shifts in sentiment over time and during major political events (e.g., elections, rallies, scandals).
* **Measure Impact of Hashtags:** Evaluate the influence of popular political hashtags like #Maandamano, #AzimioLaUmoja, #KenyaKwanza, #RutoThe5th.
* **Identify Key Influencers:** Detect influential accounts driving political discussions.

---

## **3. Tools and Technologies**

* **Data Collection:** Tweepy (Python), Twitter API, SNScrape (optional for bypassing API limits)
* **Data Preprocessing:** Pandas, NLTK, Regular Expressions
* **Sentiment Analysis:** VADER, TextBlob, BERT (Hugging Face), or a fine-tuned LLM
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, WordCloud
* **Deployment (Optional):** Streamlit or Flask for a live sentiment dashboard

---

## **4. Data Collection**

### **4.1 Twitter API Setup**

* Create a Twitter Developer account and get API keys and tokens.
* Set up the Tweepy library or use SNScrape for more flexibility.
* Filter tweets based on:

  * Keywords: Ruto, Raila, Gachagua, #KenyaPolitics, #Maandamano, #RutoThe5th
  * Language: English and Swahili
  * Location: Focus on Kenya (use geo-location filters if possible)

### **4.2 Data Collection Strategy**

* Use both real-time streaming (Twitter API v2) and historical search (SNScrape) for comprehensive coverage.
* Capture metadata like date, retweets, likes, and user followers to assess tweet impact.
* Store data in CSV files or a database like MongoDB or SQLite for scalability.

---

## **5. Data Preprocessing**

### **5.1 Cleaning and Normalization**

* Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, and emojis.
* Lowercase all text for consistency.
* Remove stopwords (e.g., “the”, “is”, “and”) to reduce noise.

### **5.2 Tokenization and Lemmatization**

* Break down tweets into individual tokens (words).
* Use lemmatization to reduce words to their root form (e.g., ‘running’ → ‘run’).

### **5.3 Handling Swahili-English Mix**

* Use a bilingual dictionary or a pre-trained model that can handle Swahili and English tweets.

---

## **6. Sentiment Analysis**

### **6.1 Model Selection**

* **Basic:** Use VADER or TextBlob for quick analysis.
* **Advanced:** Fine-tune a BERT model on Kenyan political tweets for better accuracy.
* **Custom Approach:** Create a custom sentiment lexicon for Kenyan politics if time permits.

### **6.2 Sentiment Scoring**

* Classify tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
* Use confidence scores to filter out low-confidence predictions.
* Consider sentiment modifiers like sarcasm and negation for better context.

---

## **7. Data Analysis and Visualization**

### **7.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Identify top keywords, most active users, and tweet volume over time.
* Use word clouds to visualize popular terms.

### **7.2 Time Series Analysis**

* Track sentiment changes over time to identify key political moments.
* Use moving averages to smooth noisy data.

### **7.3 Network Analysis (Optional)**

* Identify influential accounts and hashtag clusters.
* Use libraries like NetworkX for visualization.

---

## **8. Insights and Reporting**

### **8.1 Key Metrics to Measure**

* Overall sentiment distribution
* Top trending topics
* Influential accounts driving conversations
* Hashtag effectiveness

### **8.2 Final Report**

* Prepare a report summarizing findings with clear visualizations.
* Highlight key takeaways and actionable insights for political analysts, campaign teams, or media outlets.

---

## **9. Future Improvements**

* Integrate real-time dashboards for ongoing analysis.
* Include predictive modeling to forecast election outcomes or political popularity.
* Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) for deeper insights into the topics discussed.

---

## **10. Potential Challenges**

* **API Rate Limits:** Consider using SNScrape for unlimited historical data.
* **Language Complexity:** Managing code-switching and slang in Kenyan tweets.
* **Data Bias:** Avoiding political bias in data collection and model training.
* **Sentiment Accuracy:** Handling sarcasm, humor, and political jargon effectively.

## **11. Conclusion**

This project will provide a deep dive into the sentiment landscape of Kenyan politics, offering valuable insights into public opinion and political narratives. It’s a critical step towards understanding the digital political landscape as we approach future elections.
